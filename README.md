<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This quiz application tests the user's JavaScript knowledge. Questions are shown in random order, and the user is alotted 30 seconds to answer all questions. Each time a question is answered correctly, 1 point is added to the user's total score and the document background and correct answer are color coded green to indicate to the user that they answered correctly. Each time a question is answered incorrectly, 5 seconds are deducted from the timer.

The quiz ends when all questions are answered or time expires.

The user can save their score to the highscore board under their initials.

The Highscore Board is located on a different tab within the application and shows the top scores. The user can clear/reset this scoreboard at any point.
